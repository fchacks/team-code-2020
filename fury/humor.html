    <p>Today, my son asked "Can I have a book mark?" and I burst into tears. 11 years old and he still doesn't know my name is Brian.</p>
    <br>
    <p>What genre are national anthems? Country.</p>
    <br>
    <p>My daughter's boyfriend introduced himself to me. He said, "Hi sir I'm David, nice to meet you".
He put out his hand and I said "David, are you nervous?" He said no, so I grabbed his hand, looked him in the eyes, and said, "Then why are you shaking?"</p>
<br>
<p>I took my 8-year old girl to the office with me on "Take Your Kid to Work Day." As we were walking around the office, she starting crying and getting very cranky, so I asked what was wrong with her.
As my coworkers gathered round, she sobbed loudly, "Daddy, where are all the clowns that you said that you worked with?!"</p>
<br>
<p>A woman was 3 months pregnant when she fell into a deep coma and woke up after about 6 months. The woman asked the doctor about her baby.</p>
<p>Doctor: You had twins, a boy and a girl. They're both fine. And your brother named them for you.</p>
<p>Woman: No no no! Not my brother. He's an idiot! What did he name the girl?</p>
<p>Doctor: Denise.</p>
<p>Woman: Ohh, that's actually a nice name. What about the boy?</p>
<p>Doctor: <i>deep sigh</i> Denephew.</p>

<p>A man walks into a pet store and asks for a dozen bees. The clerk carefully counts 13 bees out onto the counter. “That’s one too many!” says the customer.
The clerk replies, “It’s a freebie.”</p>
<br>
<p>I saw my wife, slightly drunk, yelling at the TV: “Don’t go in there! Don’t go in the church, you moron!"</p>
<p> She is watching our wedding video again.</p>
<br>
<p>I was addicted to the hokey pokey… but thankfully, I turned myself around.</p>
<br>
<p>Some cause happiness wherever they go. Others <i>whenever</i> they go.</p>
<br>
<p>Feeling pretty proud of myself. The puzzle I bought said 3-5 years, but I finished it in 18 months.</p>
<br>
<p>Knowledge is knowing a tomato is a fruit. Wisdom is not putting it in a fruit salad.</p>
<br>
<p>Due to the quarantine I'll only be telling inside jokes. </p>

<p>Did you hear about the Italian chef that died?
He pasta way. We cannoli do so much. Theres nutelling what can happen next... His legacy will become a pizza history. Here today, gone tomato. I can only espress-so much grief, but lettuce romaine calm. How sad that he ran out of thyme. Ashes to ashes, crust to crust. There's just not mushroom left for Italian chefs in this world... Sending olive my prayers to his family. His wife is really upset, cheese still not over it... You never sausage a tragic thing. It's such a shame good people die fusilli reasons. It was a farfalle from grace... My condolences for Roberto, who died in the spaghetto. May he rest in yeast</p>
